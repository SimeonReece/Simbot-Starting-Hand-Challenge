# Hints: What Kind of Starting Hands Are You Aiming For?
You don’t need to memorize a starting hand chart. Instead, understand the rules for recognizing good hands. Below is a guide to what you should aim for:

- **Any hand that can flop trips** at a reasonable rate or **pocket pairs (PP)**.
- **Any hand that can make a ten-high (T+) flush**.
- **Any suited connector** with no more than 3 gaps between the cards.
- **Combo hands**, i.e., hands that can make both straights and flushes.
- **Any hand that can make an Ace-high two pair**, or **Ax hands**.
- **Any hand that can make a straight**, but you need a **Q+ card** to play hands like 8x.
  - Example: **J8** is no good, but **Q8** is playable.
- **Any Broadway hand** (Ten through Ace).
- **Closely connected cards** with no card lower than an 8.

## A Few Gotchas
- **Connectors**: A gap of 1-2 between cards is acceptable. Gaps above 3 make hands unplayable due to fewer combination possibilities (e.g., 9♣ 5♦ is not a starting hand to play).
- **Baby Straights**: These need to be suited since unsuited low cards are too vulnerable (e.g., 4♦ 2♠ is connected but too low). We prefer **medium straights**.
- **Situational Play**: In tournaments, starting hand selection changes. Often, you're advised to play looser, meaning you can play any hand that can make a straight or remove false positives. For example, hands like **A6**, **A7**, **A8**, and **A9** become unplayable if they cannot make a straight or flush. Sometimes, you're told to loosen up further, playing even weak suited hands like **9♣ 3♣**. These moments are covered in the mini-games.
